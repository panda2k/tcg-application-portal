### Project Overview
This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

As a result, it is built on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), 
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), and 
[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/). It also uses [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as for components. 

The code and database is designed with Google OAuth and MySQL ([Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/))
for authentication and data storage.
